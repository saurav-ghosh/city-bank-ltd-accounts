# city-bank-ltd-accounts

<p>City-bank-ltd-accounts is banking site that I build while I was doing a javascript course on udemy. I build this application to practise all the built in  methods of javascript array and number and dates internationalization. In this application, I showed all the common functionality of a online banking system. Such as: login to the account, transfer money to other account, request a loan and logged out from the account. </p>
